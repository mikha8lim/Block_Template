<p> Haro again. By the time I'm making this we're practicing for vpop, lot's of Family drama, friend group backstabbing, and this is due in 3 days. </p>

<h1> Best moments </h1>

<ol>
<li> Intrams </li>
<p> Don't give a damn if we lost. For real, this was the best one ever!!! Last year we finished 3rd, but now we finished 2nd. I'm ready to give it one more shot next year and finally claim that championship title. GGGRRRRR </p>

<li> Varsity training </li>
<p> Love hate relationship with this one hahahaha. Honestly, I just joined varsity because of _______. But honestly, it was really fun. Being part of the cluster meet 2024 is probably one of my proudest moments. I started playing vball only this January 2024, so being able to participate in an event like this gives me something to be proud of. </p>

<li> APA FRIEND GROUP </li>
<p> Love-hate relationship with this also. The people here are very moody which is kinda annoying, but who doesn't love drama right? </p>
</ol>

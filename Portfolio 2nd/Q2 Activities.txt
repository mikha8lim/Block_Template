  Storytime ulit. So, we started training for varsity. We started last September, but because of intrams training came to a halt. Intrams was such a fun event. We won 2nd place in the girl's vball and 3rd place in the overall standings. I also had my first sleepover. We had a sleepover at Santi's house. We ate a lot of food, practiced vball, watched movies, played vball, and ofc chismis. Varsity training was quite mid, but November was different. <br> <br>
  Since classes were cancelled for almost a week, we had to catch-up on a lot of activities. The first one was the historical figure contest. Sadly, we didn't win a single award. Next was booklandia. Again, we didn't win any awards. Then, comes vball. Training this month was more intense than last month. We'd go for minutes ir hours without drinking water or having a break. Before I knew it, it was the start of the cluster meet. I was really happy that my team managed to achieve a 2nd place finish in the girl's vball, but I am disappointed in myself for not contributing as much as I would have wanted. Legit I only played for like 5 minutes. It feels weird to be at the back and to be the "pabigat" when literally a month ago I was at the front receiving and defending at once. But it was surely a fun experience.
